# photons-in-scintillator
Monte Carlo simulation of the movement of photons in the detector crystal to calculate the light output.

Written as a part of my second-year coursework. The results of this simulation were compared with measurements on the real crystals with different sizes and refractive indices.

Crystal shape assumes to be rectangular. Simulation allows changing the size of the crystal, size of the hole for light output, refractive index of the crystal and the refractive index of the grease, used to glue diode to the crystal.
